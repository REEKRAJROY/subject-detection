# subject-detection in video file using Open CV 

Detection of subject in motion from a video file using Open CV library in Python.<br>

# Installing the libraries:<br>
`pip install --upgrade imutils` <br>
`pip install opencv-python` <br>






# Implementation:

(1) Constructing argument parser.<br>
(2) Resizing the video file and converting to grayscale.<br>
(3) Gaussian blurring has been implemented to focus on the subject.<br>
(4) Absolute difference and thresholding has been used.<br>
